# Social Scribe 🤖📝✨

**Stop manually summarizing meetings and drafting social media posts! Social Scribe leverages AI to transform your meeting transcripts into engaging follow-up emails and platform-specific social media content, ready to share.**

Social Scribe is a powerful Elixir and Phoenix LiveView application designed to connect to your calendars, automatically send an AI notetaker to your virtual meetings, provide accurate transcriptions via Recall.ai, and then utilize Google Gemini's advanced AI to draft compelling follow-up emails and social media posts through user-defined automation rules. It also integrates with **HubSpot** and **Salesforce**: sync meeting insights to CRM contacts and use the **Ask Anything** chat to query your contacts with AI. This project was developed with significant AI assistance, as encouraged by the challenge, to rapidly build a feature-rich application.

## ⚙️ Functionality Deep Dive

* **Connect & Sync:** Users log in with Google. The "Settings" page allows connecting multiple Google accounts, plus LinkedIn, Facebook, HubSpot, and Salesforce. For Facebook, after initial connection, users are guided to select a Page for posting. Calendars are synced to a database to populate the dashboard with upcoming events. **Ask Anything** requires at least one CRM (HubSpot or Salesforce) to be connected.
* **Record & Transcribe:** On the dashboard, users toggle "Record Meeting?" for desired events. The system extracts meeting links (Zoom, Meet) and uses Recall.ai to dispatch a bot. A background poller (`BotStatusPoller`) checks for completed recordings and transcripts, saving the data to local `Meeting`, `MeetingTranscript`, and `MeetingParticipant` tables. **Important:** Transcripts are only saved into the app when the bot was created from this app (i.e. you turned on "Record Meeting?" for that event before the meeting). If a bot joined via Recall.ai dashboard or another integration, no row exists in the app’s `recall_bots` table, so the poller will not create a meeting/transcript.
* **AI Content Generation:**
    * Once a meeting is processed, an `AIContentGenerationWorker` is enqueued.
    * This worker uses Google Gemini to draft a follow-up email.
    * It also processes all active "Automations" defined by the user. For each automation, it combines the meeting data with the user's `prompt_template` and calls Gemini to generate content (e.g., a LinkedIn post), saving it as an `AutomationResult`.
* **Social Posting:**
    * From the "Meeting Details" page, users can view AI-generated email drafts and posts from their automations.
    * "Copy" buttons are available.
    * "Post" buttons allow direct posting to LinkedIn (as the user) and the selected Facebook Page (as the Page).
* **CRM Contact Updates (HubSpot & Salesforce):** From a meeting detail page, users can open the HubSpot modal or "Update in Salesforce" to search for a contact, see AI-suggested field updates from the transcript, and apply them to the CRM.

---

## 🔗 Salesforce Integration

* **OAuth (Connected App):** Implemented in `lib/social_scribe_web/controllers/salesforce_auth_controller.ex`. Uses PKCE; callback URL must include `/dashboard` (e.g. `http://localhost:4000/dashboard/auth/salesforce/callback`). Credentials are stored in the `crm_connections` table with `provider: "salesforce"` (access token, refresh token, instance URL, expires_at).
* **Token Refresh:** The Salesforce API client (`lib/social_scribe/salesforce_api.ex`) refreshes expired tokens when making requests; no separate cron worker is used.
* **Meeting → Contact Updates:** From **Meeting Details** → **Update in Salesforce**, users search for a Salesforce contact, then see AI-generated suggested updates (via Gemini) for fields such as title, phone, and description. Users select which fields to update and submit; `SalesforceApi.update_contact` applies the changes.
* **Ask Anything:** When Salesforce is connected, the **Ask** page uses it for contact search and for answering questions with contact context (same flow as HubSpot).
* **Setup:** See [docs/SALESFORCE_SETUP.md](docs/SALESFORCE_SETUP.md) for creating a Connected App, callback URL, scopes, and sandbox vs production.

## 💬 Ask Anything (Ask Me) Chat

* **Purpose:** Chat with AI about your CRM contacts. Answers are generated by Google Gemini using the contact data you attach.
* **Access:** Dashboard → **Ask** (or `/dashboard/ask`). Requires HubSpot or Salesforce to be connected in Settings.
* **Contact Context:** Type `@` in the message box to open contact search. Search by name/email; select a contact to attach it. You can attach multiple contacts; the AI uses their CRM data to answer your question. Attached contacts appear as tags and can be removed.
* **Sessions & History:** Each conversation is a session. Use "New chat" to start a fresh session. The "History" tab lists previous sessions; click one to load it and continue in the "Chat" tab.
* **Backend:** `SocialScribe.Chat` manages sessions and messages (`crm_chat_sessions`, `crm_chat_messages`). Contact search and answer generation use the connected CRM (HubSpot or Salesforce) and `AIContentGeneratorApi.generate_contact_question_answer/2`.

---

## 🔗 HubSpot Integration

### HubSpot OAuth Integration

* **Custom Ueberauth Strategy:** Implemented in `lib/ueberauth/strategy/hubspot.ex`
* **OAuth 2.0 Flow:** Handles authorization code flow with HubSpot's `/oauth/authorize` and `/oauth/v1/token` endpoints
* **Credential Storage:** Credentials stored in `user_credentials` table with `provider: "hubspot"`, including `token`, `refresh_token`, and `expires_at`
* **Token Refresh:**
    * `HubspotTokenRefresher` Oban cron worker runs every 5 minutes to proactively refresh tokens expiring within 10 minutes
    * Internal `with_token_refresh/2` wrapper automatically refreshes expired tokens on API calls and retries the request
    * Refresh failures are logged; users are prompted to re-authenticate if refresh token is invalid

### HubSpot Modal UI

* **LiveView Component:** Located at `lib/social_scribe_web/live/meeting_live/hubspot_modal_component.ex`
* **Contact Search:** Debounced input triggers HubSpot API search, results displayed in dropdown
* **AI Suggestions:** Fetched via `HubspotSuggestions.generate_suggestions` which calls Gemini with transcript context
* **Suggestion Cards:** Each card displays:
    * Field label
    * Current value (strikethrough)
    * Arrow
    * Suggested value
    * Timestamp link
* **Selective Updates:** Checkbox per field allows selective updates; "Update HubSpot" button disabled until at least one field selected
* **Form Submission:** Batch-updates selected contact properties via `HubspotApi.update_contact`
* **Click-away Handler:** Closes dropdown without clearing selection

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

* **Facebook Posting & App Review:**
    * Posting to Facebook is implemented via the Graph API to a user-managed Page.
    * Full functionality for all users (especially those not app administrators/developers/testers) typically requires a thorough app review process by Meta, potentially including Business Verification. This is standard for apps using Page APIs.
    * During development, posting will be most reliable for app admins to Pages they directly manage.
* **Error Handling & UI Polish:** While core paths are robustly handled, comprehensive error feedback for all API edge cases and advanced UI polish are areas for continued development beyond the initial 48-hour scope.
* **Prompt Templating for Automations:** The current automation prompt templating is basic (string replacement). A more sophisticated templating engine (e.g., EEx or a dedicated library) would be a future improvement.
* **Agenda Integration:** Currently we only sync when the calendar event has a `hangoutLink` or `location` field with a zoom or google meet link.
